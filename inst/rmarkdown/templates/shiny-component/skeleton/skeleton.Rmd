This example module is reproduced from <https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html>.

Currently, `shinyComponents` doesn't use the Markdown text in the component `.Rmd`.
You can use this text to document or explain your component.

For example, we start with an R chunk.
Any standard R chunks are _global_, 
analogous to code that would be included in `global.R` in a Shiny app.

```{r}
# global setup code shared between UI and Server
```

In a Shiny Component `.Rmd` file, there are two additional chunk types:
`ui` and `server` chunks.

You can have a single unnamed chunk for each of `ui` and `server`.
For small components, you only need these two chunks.
For larger components, 
or for components that you would like to split into composable pieces,
you can name the `ui` and `server` chunks.
They then become available in the `$ui$<name>` function.

For example, here's a `$ui$plot()` function.
This will display the histogram created as the `"hist"` output in the `server` chunk.

```{ui plot}
plotOutput(ns("hist"))
```

We also have a `$ui$controls()` function,
which includes a variable selection and a numeric input to control the bins.
You can imagine wanting to place the controls and the plot in separate places in future apps,
so we've separated the controls from the plot.

Notice that there are two additional chunk opts set in this `ui` chunk:

- `.tagList = TRUE` adds each expression in the chunk in a `tagList()`
- `... = list()` is used to declare arguments to the `$ui$controls()` function:
    - `var` defaults to `"mpg"`
    - `bins` defaults to `10`

```{ui controls, .tagList = TRUE, ... = list(var = "mpg", bins = 10)}
selectInput(ns("var"), "Variable", names(mtcars), selected = var)
numericInput(ns("bins"), "Bins", value = as.integer(bins), min = 1)
```

Finally, we have our unnamed `ui` chunk.
This chunk can serve one of two purposes:

- It can be used to provide a default arrangement of the component's UI pieces.
- Or it can be a complete UI that is used for demonstrating _how_ the UI pieces work.

Notice that we've repeated the `$ui$controls()` arguments here.
This UI chunk will create a `$ui$ui()` function
and we'll now be able to set the `$ui$controls()` arguments from the `$ui$ui()` function.

```{ui, ... = list(var = "mpg", bins = 10)}
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(
    h2("Shiny Component Demo", id = "demo-header"),
    self$ui$controls(var, bins)
  ),
  mainPanel(self$ui$plot())
)
```

Next we have our `server` chunk.
This chunk becomes `$server()`, because there is only one unnamed `server` chunk.

```{server}
data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])
output$hist <- renderPlot({
  hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
})
```

Finally, you may also have JavaScript (`js`) and CSS (`css`) chunks.
These chunks are made available as `$assets()`.
These assets are automatically included when you call `$ui()` or `$app()`,
but they aren't included when you use the component pieces
so that you can manage when and how they are added to your larger Shiny app yourself.

```{css echo=FALSE}
.red {
  color: #d33f49
}
```

```{js}
setTimeout(function() {
  var demoHeader = document.getElementById('demo-header')
  if (demoHeader) demoHeader.classList.add('red')
}, 2000)
```

To preview your app, you can click the "Knit" button.
(You will have to stop the knit process to re-knit, though).

Or you can load your component and run `$app()`.

```r
library(shinyComponents)
cmp <- ShinyComponent$new("component.Rmd")
cmp$app()
```
