# shinyComponents

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The goal of shinyComponents is to turn R Markdown documents in self-contained
Shiny components.
Like [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
meets [Shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html)
(without that _ShadowDOM_ business).

## Installation

You can install the released version of shinyComponents from Github.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/shinyComponents")
```

## Example

Writing a Shiny component often requires wiring together a number of different languages:
R for the Shiny UI and Server pieces, 
CSS for styling, 
JavaScript for interactivity,
and more R for data and other things.

Imagine you've written out all of those pieces in a R Markdown file,
like the one in the details section below (click to expand).

<details><summary>Example R Markdown: <code>example-component.Rmd</code></summary>

````markdown
`r paste(readLines(system.file("example-component.Rmd", package = "shinyComponents")), collapse = "\n")`
````

</details>

To read the component from the R Markdown, 
load `shinyComponents` and create a new `ShinyComponent`.

```{r example}
library(shinyComponents)

ex_rmd <- system.file("example-component.Rmd", package = "shinyComponents")

ex <- ShinyComponent$new(ex_rmd)
```

The chunk named `ui` becomes available in the `ui()` method,
making a chunk like this

````markdown
```{r ui}`r ''`
h3(initial_header)
sliderInput("number", "Pick a number", min = 0, max = 10, value = 1)
verbatimTextOutput("debug")
```
````

available in the `$ui()` method.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ex$ui()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(ex$ui())
```

The `server` chunk is available in the server method `$server()`,
to be called anywhere in your server function.
Any CSS or JavaScript chunks are concatenated and included in appropriate
`<style>` and `<script>` tags when you call the `$assets()` method.

Here's a bare bone Shiny app incorporating all of the pieces.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)

ex <- ShinyComponent$new(ex_rmd)

ui <- fluidPage(
  ex$ui(),
  ex$assets()
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ex$server()
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Or you can run a demo app that pulls the components together
into an app just like the one above.

``` r
ex$app()
```
